    <ul class="rules">RULES
      <li class="rule">Players alternate turns dealing cards face up into the central pile</li>
      <li class="rule">A player can "slap" at any time, with several outcomes!</li>
      <li class="rule">If a jack is on top of the central pile when a player slaps, the central pile is added to their hand</li>
      <li class="rule">Same rule applies to doubles, and sandwiches(a pair with any random card in the middle)</li>
      <li class="rule">If a player slaps when none of those examples are true, that player forfeits their top card to the other's hand</li>
      <li class="rule">If a player runs out of cards, they will be on their last stand where they have one chance to get back into the game</li>
      <li class="rule">The player with cards remaining will deal until a jack is revealed and the empty player will be able to try and slap</li>
      <li class="rule">Doubles and sandwiches are no longer valid for the player on their last stand</li>
      <li class="rule">The empty player may only attempt to slap on a jack, if they are successful then they can reenter the game with the newly added central pile in their hand</li>
      <li class="rule">If however the player who is out of cards slaps something other than a jack, or the other player slaps that jack first, the empty player loses</li>
    </ul>
